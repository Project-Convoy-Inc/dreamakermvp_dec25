# Expand Onboarding Requirements in PRD

## Overview

The PRD currently has a brief onboarding section (6.3) that needs significant expansion to reflect the critical importance of the onboarding experience. The onboarding must guide users through creating their first vision, which serves as both a learning experience and a foundation for future vision creation.

## Changes to Make

### 1. Expand Section 6.3 Onboarding in User Experience Requirements

**Location**: [README.md](README.md) lines 287-291Transform the current brief bullet points into a comprehensive section with:

- **6.3.1 Feature Description**: Explain that onboarding is a critical first experience that guides users through creating their first vision
- **6.3.2 Onboarding Goals**: 
- Help users understand how the platform works
- Enable users to create their first vision
- Set foundation for creating additional visions
- Build confidence in using the platform
- **6.3.3 Onboarding Flow Placeholder**: Add a placeholder section for the detailed onboarding outline (to be provided by user)
- **6.3.4 First Vision Creation**: Detail how onboarding guides users through creating their first vision, including:
- Step-by-step guidance through vision creation
- Education about how visions work in the platform
- Demonstration of key features through the first vision
- Connection to other platform features (reflection, accountability, community)
- **6.3.5 Functional Requirements**: 
- Users can complete onboarding at their own pace
- Users can skip and return to onboarding later
- First vision creation is integrated into onboarding flow
- Onboarding demonstrates how to create additional visions
- Progress is saved throughout onboarding
- **6.3.6 Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Onboarding is engaging and supportive (not overwhelming)
- Clear, encouraging language throughout
- Visual guidance and examples
- Responsive and accessible design

### 2. Add Onboarding to Core Features (Optional Enhancement)

**Location**: After section 3.4 (around line 217)Consider adding a new section 3.5 "Onboarding Experience" to emphasize its importance as a core feature, or keep it in UX section but reference it from Core Features.

### 3. Update Success Criteria

**Location**: [README.md](README.md) lines 293-312Add onboarding-specific metrics:

- **7.2 User Adoption Metrics**: Add "Onboarding completion rate > 80%"
- **7.2 User Adoption Metrics**: Add "First vision creation completion rate > 75%"
- **7.2 User Adoption Metrics**: Update existing "70% of users complete initial life vision setup" to reference onboarding completion

### 4. Update MVP Launch Criteria

**Location**: [README.md](README.md) line 300Ensure "User onboarding flow is complete" is detailed enough, or expand to mention first vision creation requirement.

## Implementation Notes

- The detailed onboarding outline will be provided by the user in a follow-up, so include a clear placeholder section
- Emphasize that first vision creation during onboarding is both educational and functional
