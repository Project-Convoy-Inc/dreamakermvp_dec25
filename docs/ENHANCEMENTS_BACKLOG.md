## 1. Onboarding/Vision Creation Process Enhancement

### Current State
Basic onboarding flow exists but lacks detailed step-by-step guidance for first vision creation.

### Enhancement Details from Transcript

#### 1.1 Avatar Selection & Customization
- **Feature**: Users pick an avatar that becomes their sidekick
- **Customization**: Users can customize avatar to be "more and more of what I need in a sidekick"
- **Purpose**: Avatar is the interface for communicating with vision board moving forward
- **Implementation Notes**: 
  - Avatar selection should be part of onboarding
  - Customization options should be available
  - Avatar persists as sidekick throughout platform

#### 1.2 Enhanced Vision Creation Flow
The transcript reveals a detailed 10-step vision creation process:

**Step 1: "What do I want?"**
- Text or voice input (even split preference among users)
- Users describe one thing from their big vision that comes top of mind
- Example: "I would like to pilot a platform with 25 young professionals within an organization"

**Step 2: Visualization/Activation**
- Guided prompt: "Close your eyes and activate the regions of your brain that focus on action"
- Users think about what it would look like once they achieve this goal
- Creates mental picture before describing

**Step 3: Describe What You Saw**
- Users describe their visualization in detail
- Can be text or voice input
- Example: "I am sitting at a table with twenty-five young professionals who are separated into groups of five circles each..."

**Step 4: Current Status**
- Prompt: "Where am I with this right now?"
- Users describe their current situation/context
- Important for platform to suggest next steps
- Example: "I'm chatting with coaches and guides that help young professionals achieve their dreams..."

**Step 5: Materials Upload**
- Users can upload plans, syllabus, or structured documents
- Platform takes these into consideration for understanding and suggestions
- Enhances platform's understanding of what might go forward

**Step 6: Recap**
- Review everything shared before generation
- Opportunity to review and confirm all information

**Step 7: User Likeness Option**
- Option to include photo of self or describe self
- User can be added into the visualization
- Rationale: "When we can see ourselves in a specific winning moment, it is easier to feel really excited about it and gain that forward momentum"
- Can be skipped if desired

**Step 8: Image Generation**
- Platform generates vision image based on all collected information
- Uses: what user wants, visualization description, current status, materials, user likeness (if provided)

**Step 9: Regenerate Option**
- Users can change or regenerate image if not satisfied
- Allows iteration until user is happy with visualization

**Step 10: Reference Image Upload (Future Feature)**
- Users can provide reference images (e.g., what the room looks like)
- Makes visualization "as real as possible"
- Enhances clarity of visualization

#### 1.3 User-Generated Content First Approach
- **Feature**: Invite and encourage users to input their own images, art, collage, or creative visual/written content first
- **Workflow**: 
  1. User creates/inputs their own visual or creative content (images, art, collage, written content)
  2. AI can then enhance user's content if they so choose
  3. Alternative: AI can create from scratch if user prefers
- **Purpose**: Makes tool more powerful and personal
- **Philosophy**: User-generated content first, AI enhancement second (vs. AI creating automatically from scratch)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Option to upload user-created images/art/collage
  - Option to write/create visual content within platform
  - Toggle/choice between user-generated + AI enhancement vs. AI-generated from scratch
- **Value**: More meaningful and personal tool when users contribute their own creative work

#### 1.4 Values Development & Reflection Depth
- **Current Issue**: Platform feels too quick to action, jumping to activities before sufficient reflection
- **Enhancement**: Linger longer in developing values and understanding why things are important
- **Approach**: 
  - Spend more time exploring core values before moving to action
  - Deepen understanding of why goals/values are important to the user
  - Ensure values foundation is well-established before suggesting activities
- **Coaching Philosophy**: Typical coaching process involves deeper exploration before action planning
- **Implementation**: 
  - Expand values exploration step(s) in onboarding/vision creation
  - Add reflection prompts about importance and meaning
  - Ensure values are clearly established before roadmap/activities appear
- **Timing**: Values development should happen before jumping to action items

#### 1.5 Research-Backed Information Nuggets
- **Feature**: Integrate nuggets of research-backed information throughout the onboarding and vision creation process
- **Purpose**: Provide users with scientific context about the process they're engaging in
- **Content**: Science-backed information about visualization, goal-setting, values development, etc.
- **Placement**: Strategically placed throughout the process to educate and validate the approach
- **Implementation**: 
  - Research literature review to find relevant studies and findings
  - Integrate information nuggets at appropriate moments in the flow
  - Present in digestible, non-overwhelming format
- **Value**: Helps users understand the science behind the process, increasing engagement and trust

### Priority
🟡 Medium-High (Core user experience improvement)

### Status
To be implemented

## 2. Vision Board Organization Enhancement

### Current State
Vision board has basic short-term vs. long-term organization.

### Enhancement Details from Transcript

#### 2.1 Three Time-Based Lanes
- **Short-term Goals**: Things working on within the month
- **Mid-term Goals**: Medium-term aspirations
- **Long-term Goals**: Long-term dreams and aspirations
- **Visual Organization**: Lanes should be clearly separated and labeled

#### 2.2 Core Values Foundation
- **Location**: Core values appear below all goals as the foundation
- **Purpose**: Core values are what's really driving everything above
- **Dynamic Display**: As users put dreams and goals on the board, core values start to show up
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Values form the foundation layer visually

#### 2.3 Life Area Categories
- **Categories**: work, wealth, family, friends, health, spirituality, interest
- **Framework**: "Seven aspects of life" - aligns with life design workshop methodology
- **Workshop Context**: Life design workshops guide users through clarifying what they want in seven aspects of life that are important to them
- **Purpose**: Enables users to organize goals by life area
- **Integration**: Categories help users see how different areas connect
- **Note**: The seven categories map to the "seven aspects of life" framework used in life design workshops

#### 2.4 Rapid-Fire Goal Entry
- **Feature**: Users can quickly add multiple goals as placeholders
- **Workflow**: 
  1. User goes through full visualization process for first goal
  2. Lands on vision board
  3. Can rapid-fire add other goals as placeholders
  4. Work through each one later, creating full visualizations
- **Purpose**: Allows users to capture all ideas quickly, then refine later

#### 2.5 Simplicity Principle
- **Guidance**: Keep it simple per area of life
- **Time-Based Organization**: 
  - Some things achievable within month → short-term
  - Other things take more time → mid-term or long-term
- **Balance**: Helps users maintain clarity without feeling overwhelmed
- **Value Proposition**: 
  - Users can "make small progress toward everything and feel like I've got clarity about where I'm going"
  - "It doesn't feel like I'm trying to constantly manage all these interests I have and things I want to do with the bigger focus elements of my day-to-day"
  - Vision board helps manage complexity without overwhelm
  - Users can work on goals "as I'm ready" - flexibility without constant management pressure

#### 3.3 User-Identified Activities First (Coaching Approach)
- **Feature**: Ask users to identify what activities they think they should do first, before AI suggests activities
- **Purpose**: More pure coaching approach - help users be self-resourced
- **Philosophy**: "The more you help users be self-resourced, the more meaningful it can be for the user"
- **Workflow**:
  1. User identifies activities they think they should do in service of their goal
  2. User inputs their own activity ideas first
  3. Then AI can suggest additional activities if desired
  4. Combines user's self-knowledge with AI suggestions
- **Implementation**: 
  - Prompt users to list activities they think they should do
  - Collect user-generated activity ideas before showing AI suggestions
  - AI suggestions appear after user has contributed their own ideas
- **Value**: Empowers users and makes experience more meaningful through self-reflection

#### 3.4 Streamlined Initial Activity Suggestions
- **Current Issue**: "Give it a try" curated activities feel overwhelming with so many options
- **Enhancement**: Streamline number of activities in initial set
- **Initial Set**: Just 3 core suggestions - 1 Curious, 1 Brave, 1 Bold (one for each difficulty level)
- **On-Demand Expansion**: If users want more suggestions, they can ask for more
- **Purpose**: Reduce overwhelm, provide focused starting point
- **Implementation**:
  - Default to showing only 3 activities (one per level: Curious, Brave, Bold)
  - "Show more suggestions" button/option available
  - Progressive disclosure - start simple, expand on request
- **User Control**: Users can request additional activity suggestions when ready

  - Completed activities
  - Achievements
  - What user has learned
- **Purpose**: Activities evolve as user progresses
- **Context-Aware**: Suggestions make sense as next steps based on what's been completed

#### 3.8 Commitment System
- **Feature**: Users commit to trying a specific challenge before starting activity
- **Input**: User types in what they commit to trying for this specific challenge
- **Purpose**: Creates accountability and intentionality
- **Workflow**: Commit → Start Activity

#### 3.9 Purpose & Use Case
