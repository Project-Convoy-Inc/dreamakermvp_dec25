# Onboarding Experience Requirements

## Overview

The onboarding experience is a critical first interaction that sets the foundation for users' success on the platform. It provides a guided, supportive introduction to Dreamaker's framework, helping users understand how the platform works while enabling them to create their first vision. This first vision serves as both a learning experience and a practical foundation, demonstrating how different journeys and aspects of life can be unified under one integrated system. The onboarding experience empowers users to feel confident in using the platform and sets them up to continue creating additional visions independently.

## Onboarding Goals

- Help users understand how the Dreamaker framework works
- Enable users to create their first vision through guided steps
- Demonstrate how visions integrate different life areas and journeys
- Build user confidence in navigating the platform
- Set foundation for users to create additional visions independently
- Connect users to other platform features (reflection, accountability, community)
- Align with "made by them, for them" philosophy - showing users their own insights

## Onboarding Flow Outline

*[Placeholder: Detailed onboarding flow outline to be provided]*

The onboarding flow will guide users through:
- Platform introduction and value proposition
- Creating their first vision (step-by-step guidance)
- Understanding how visions work and connect different life areas
- Introduction to other core features
- How to create additional visions after onboarding

## First Vision Creation

The onboarding experience includes a comprehensive, guided process for creating the user's first vision. This process:
- Walks users through each step of vision creation
- Educates users about how visions work within the Dreamaker framework
- Demonstrates how different life areas and journeys can be unified
- Shows how to document dreams and goals across various life areas
- Provides examples and guidance without being prescriptive
- Saves progress throughout, allowing users to complete at their own pace
- Connects the first vision to other platform features (reflection space, accountability tracking, community connection)
- Empowers users to understand they can create additional visions using the same process
