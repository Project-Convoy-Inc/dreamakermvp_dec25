# Onboarding Experience Requirements

## Overview

The onboarding experience is a critical first interaction that sets the foundation for users' success on the platform. It provides a guided, supportive introduction to Dreamaker's framework, helping users understand how the platform works while enabling them to create their first vision. This first vision serves as both a learning experience and a practical foundation, demonstrating how different journeys and aspects of life can be unified under one integrated system. 

The onboarding experience is designed to be both educational and functional - it teaches users how the platform works while simultaneously enabling them to create a real, usable vision. Through this guided first vision creation, users learn the process, understand how visions work in the platform, and see demonstrations of key features. The onboarding experience empowers users to feel confident in using the platform and sets them up to continue creating additional visions independently.

## Onboarding Goals

- Help users understand how the Dreamaker framework works
- Enable users to create their first vision through guided steps
- Demonstrate how visions integrate different life areas and journeys
- Build user confidence in navigating the platform
- Set foundation for users to create additional visions independently
- Connect users to other platform features (reflection, accountability, community)
- Align with "made by them, for them" philosophy - showing users their own insights

## First Vision Creation

The onboarding experience includes a comprehensive, guided process for creating the user's first vision. This process serves dual purposes: it is both educational (teaching users how the platform works) and functional (creating a real, usable vision).

### Educational Aspects
- Walks users through each step of vision creation with clear, step-by-step guidance
- Educates users about how visions work within the Dreamaker framework
- Demonstrates how different life areas and journeys can be unified under one integrated system
- Shows how to document dreams and goals across various life areas
- Provides examples and guidance without being prescriptive
- Demonstrates how to create additional visions after onboarding completion
- Explains how visions connect to other platform features (reflection space, accountability tracking, community connection)

### Functional Aspects
- Creates a real, usable vision that becomes part of the user's vision board
- Generates a personalized vision image that serves as a visual anchor for their goal
- Saves progress throughout, allowing users to complete at their own pace
- Connects the first vision to other platform features for immediate use
