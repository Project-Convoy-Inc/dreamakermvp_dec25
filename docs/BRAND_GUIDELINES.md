## 1. Brand Identity

### 1.1 Brand Name
**Dreamaker** - Empowering courageous people to clarify their dreams and make them reality.

### 1.2 Brand Philosophy
**"Made by them, for them"** - All insights are their own, and we are fully transparent with users about what data is used and how it informs what we share with them. We believe in empowering users with their own wisdom and providing complete transparency about how their information is used to support their journey.

### 1.3 Brand Direction & Personality

#### Core Brand Essence
Dreamaker sells the idea of working towards your goals in an **achievable way**. The experience has a somatic element that doesn't feel as rigid as "checklist" or "streak" style apps. The brand direction is **whimsical** - similar to meditation apps that have goal-focused components but try not to overwhelm users with unachievable tasks.

#### Brand Personality Traits
- **Achievable**: Goals feel within reach, not overwhelming
- **Whimsical**: Playful but not overly so (less playful than Headspace)
- **Supportive**: Like a gentle guide, not a taskmaster
- **Dream-like**: Subtle, ethereal quality (inspired by Ten Percent Happier)
- **Somatic**: Body-aware, present-moment focused
- **Clear Direction**: Structure and pacing that feels achievable (inspired by Headspace)

#### Design Inspiration
- **Headspace**: Pacing and structure - achievable with clear direction (but less playful)
- **Ash (AI Therapy)**: Cards with subtle gradient backgrounds
- **Ten Percent Happier**: Subtle gradients, dream-like aesthetic
- **Pillowtalk (AI Journaling)**: Tone of voice, darker palette with pops of color

#### Design Philosophy (Core Principles)
1. **Achievable**: Goals feel within reach, not overwhelming
2. **Whimsical**: Playful but not overly so (less playful than Headspace)
3. **Dream-like**: Subtle, ethereal quality (inspired by Ten Percent Happier)

5. **Clear Direction**: Structure and pacing that feels achievable (inspired by Headspace)
6. **Subtle Gradients**: Dream-like, barely perceptible (inspired by Ten Percent Happier and Ash)
7. **Simple Typography**: Round sans-serif, single font family for MVP
8. **Darker Palette with Pops**: Dark mode inspiration from Pillowtalk

**What to Avoid**: Checklist/streak app rigidity, overwhelming task lists, too playful (more playful than Headspace), harsh gradients or high contrast, complex typography systems, hard-edged fonts

**What to Embrace**: Meditation app pacing and structure, subtle dream-like gradients, card-based layouts with subtle backgrounds, achievable goal presentation, somatic present-moment focus, simple round typography, whimsical touches without being too casual

### 1.4 Brand Messaging
- **Core Value Proposition**: Dreamaker is the antidote for people feeling so overwhelmed that they throw in the towel on what they truly want. By providing structure, clarity, support, and accountability in one integrated platform, we help users navigate life transitions without losing sight of their authentic desires and dreams.
- **Mission**: Provide clarity, support, and accountability to help people discover what they truly want in life and take meaningful action toward their dreams.
- **Vision**: Scale Dreamaker to a point where anyone who wants to use the platform but cannot afford it can be sponsored through our related non-profit organization.

### 1.5 Tone of Voice

#### Voice Characteristics
- **Supportive**: Encouraging and empowering
- **Clear**: Direct and easy to understand

#### Tone Inspiration

- **Avoid**: Checklist rigidity, streak-focused intensity, overwhelming task lists

#### Example Messaging
- **Welcome**: "You've already taken the first step to design the life you want and go after it."

- **Guidance**: "So that I can help guide you, tell me where you are with this today."
- **Celebration**: "Your vision is ready!"

## 2. Typography

### 2.1 Font Selection (MVP - Simple & Round)

#### Primary Font Family (Sans-Serif)
For MVP, use a simple, round sans-serif font. Recommended options (all free Google Fonts):

1. **Nunito** (Recommended)
   - Round, friendly, approachable
   - Good readability
   - Multiple weights available

2. **DM Sans**
   - Clean, modern, slightly rounded
   - Excellent readability
   - Professional yet approachable

3. **Be Vietnam Pro**
   - Rounded edges, friendly
   - Good for body text
   - Clear hierarchy

**Selection Criteria**: Choose one font that feels more round than hard-edged, suitable for both headings and body text to keep MVP simple.

#### Font Usage
- **Single Font Family**: Use the selected font for both headings and body text (MVP simplicity)
- **Weights**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)
- **Style**: Sans-serif, rounded edges preferred over sharp/hard edges

### 2.2 Logo Typography

#### Logo Design Direction
- **Super Simple**: Just a bolder version of the selected font
- **No Complex Graphics**: Keep it minimal for MVP
- **Star/Sparkle Element**: Current star/sparkle direction is good
  - **Enhancement Suggestion**: Use Nano Banana (or similar tool) to make it more illustrative
  - **Placement**: Can be integrated with or separate from wordmark

#### Logo Typography Specs
- **Font**: Bold weight of selected primary font
- **Style**: Simple, clean wordmark
- **Accent**: Illustrative star/sparkle element (enhanced version)

### 2.3 Typography Hierarchy

#### Headings
- **Style**: Bold, using selected sans-serif font
- **Color**: Primary purple for main headings
- **Size**: Responsive (larger on desktop, smaller on mobile)
- **Weight**: Bold (700) for h1, Semibold (600) for h2-h3

#### Body Text
- **Style**: Regular weight, using selected sans-serif font
- **Color**: Foreground or muted-foreground
- **Size**: Base size with responsive scaling
- **Weight**: Regular (400) for body, Medium (500) for emphasis

#### Instructions/Helper Text
- **Style**: Smaller, lighter weight
- **Color**: Muted-foreground
- **Size**: Smaller than body text
- **Weight**: Regular (400) or Light (300) if available

### 2.4 Typography Implementation Notes

**Current State**: The codebase currently uses Playfair Display (serif) for headings and Inter (sans-serif) for body text.

**MVP Transition**: For MVP simplicity, transition to a single round sans-serif font family (Nunito, DM Sans, or Be Vietnam Pro) for both headings and body text.

**Future Consideration**: After MVP, may return to a display + body font combination, but for now, simplicity is key.

- **Section**: `@layer base :root` and `.dark`

### 10.2 Tailwind Configuration
Theme extensions are defined in:
- **File**: `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Sections**: `theme.extend.colors`, `theme.extend.fontFamily`, `theme.extend.boxShadow`

### 10.3 Typography Implementation

**Current State**: The codebase currently uses Playfair Display (serif) for headings and Inter (sans-serif) for body text.

**MVP Transition**: For MVP simplicity, transition to a single round sans-serif font family (Nunito, DM Sans, or Be Vietnam Pro) for both headings and body text. Once a font is selected, update the font imports in `src/index.css`, update the fontFamily configuration in `tailwind.config.ts` to use only the selected font, and update heading styles to use the sans-serif font instead of the display font.

**Future Consideration**: After MVP, may return to a display + body font combination, but for now, simplicity is key.

### 10.4 Component Usage
- Use Tailwind utility classes: `bg-primary`, `text-primary`, `border-primary`
- Use CSS variables in custom CSS: `hsl(var(--primary))`
- Use domain colors: `bg-domain-work`, `text-domain-health`

### 10.5 Logo Enhancement
- **Current**: Existing star/sparkle logo
- **Enhancement**: Make star/sparkle element more illustrative while maintaining whimsical feel
- **Wordmark**: Simple, bold version of selected font
