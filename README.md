# Dreamaker MVP - December 2025

## About Dreamaker

Dreamaker is a transformative platform designed for courageous individuals navigating significant life transitions. Our mission is to provide clarity, support, and accountability to help people discover what they truly want in life and take meaningful action toward their dreams.

## What We Do

Dreamaker offers a complete system that empowers users to:

- **Clarify their vision** - Discover and articulate what they truly want in life
- **Take action** - Move forward with purpose and intention
- **Stay accountable** - Maintain momentum through structured support
- **Build connection** - Access a community of support and understanding
- **Create lasting change** - Develop systems they can carry with them for life

## Who It's For

Dreamaker is for anyone going through a big life transition who needs:
- Clarity about their direction and desires
- A structured approach to achieving their goals
- Accountability and support systems
- Connection with others on similar journeys
- An antidote to feeling so overwhelmed that they throw in the towel on what they truly want

## Our Philosophy

Dreamaker is **made by them, for them**. All insights are their own, and we are fully transparent with users about what data is used and how it informs what we share with them. We believe in empowering users with their own wisdom and providing complete transparency about how their information is used to support their journey.

## Our Vision

Our goal is to scale Dreamaker to a point where anyone who wants to use the platform but cannot afford it can be sponsored through our related non-profit organization. We believe everyone deserves access to the tools and support needed to navigate life transitions and pursue their dreams.

## MVP Features (December 2025)

This MVP includes the critical features that make it possible for our users to feel clear and supported as they find their way:

### 1. Integrated Life Vision
A dedicated space where users can share their different dreams and goals across various areas of their life. This feature helps users get the full picture of what makes their life feel integrated, allowing them to see how different aspects of their life connect and support each other.

### 2. Community Connection
A section where users can connect with others, share experiences, and learn from one another. This creates a supportive network of people on similar journeys, fostering mutual understanding and growth.

### 3. Reflection Space
A dedicated section for users to reflect on their journey, process their experiences, and gain deeper insights into themselves and their path forward.

### 4. Accountability & Progress Tracking
A comprehensive system that helps users stay accountable and visualize their progress toward building a meaningful life. This feature enables users to track milestones, celebrate achievements, and maintain momentum.

## Core Value Proposition

Dreamaker is the antidote for people feeling so overwhelmed that they throw in the towel on what they truly want. By providing structure, clarity, support, and accountability in one integrated platform, we help users navigate life transitions without losing sight of their authentic desires and dreams.

Dreamaker is not a platform to build one specific type of community. Instead, it is a framework that allows users to bring the different journeys and aspects of their life under one unified journey so they can find and enjoy alignment.
